# Scientific Computing with Python 3
This is the code repository for [Scientific Computing with Python 3](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/scientific-computing-python-3-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786463517), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



Every book chapter corresponds to a folder.

These folders contain:


1) An Jupyter notebook file  (execute first in a command window:
   jupyter notebook


2) A correponding html-file with notebook's output

3) The editable python code

The code will look like the following:
```
A block of code is set as follows:

from scipy import *
from matplotlib.pyplot import *

Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
jupyter notebook
```

You would need Pyhon3.5 or higher, SciPy, NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython shell (we recommend strongly to install Python and its packages through Anaconda). The examples of the book do not have any special hardware requirements on memory and graphics
